Known Issues:
1. Regex to convert string to object: Easy but tedious to fix - If these are important to anyone, let me know!
	a) will not ignore escaped qoutes.  Use double/single quotes. 
	b) Objects nested more than one layer deep will not become objects (a:b:c will become {a:{b:c}}), but so will a:b:c:d, which will become a:{b:{c:d}}
2. Throws an error sometimes when inline
3. When inline - clicking the bar should not make it dissapear!!

Ideapad:
a) Add variable to signify whether or not buttons should be run.
b) Add support for args to be a function. Run function for value of args.
c) Editing functions should not work out of the scope of the toolbar's fields (I shouldn't be able to click on a button on the "wrong" toolbar, and certainly not a field is not meant to be editable.  Currently applies to shortcuts)
d) inline toolbar class should be added to button hash, for the who want all their toolbars on the same line (like toolbars in word)
e) create a structure to add or remove elements with a .mooInline().  Adding should be made available for all elements that are passed if option is set.
f) default styles for 'a' etc should be added to api docs
g) add object of functions it should check on each update key {widetBtn:function(){widteVar?true:false;}}
h) add an onExpand, onExpandHidden and onCollapse, and a onCollapse function
i) and a expanded() when all are, or a different set of rules for init on menus?
j) onIint:expand() and expandHidden should expand.
k) Add a tab button.
l) Add an onHide() handler
m) add the logic of hides to the API.
n) Logic for overflow [buttons that dont fit] should be added to either each button in the Hash, or globally.  Options should be noted.
o) Add invisible parameter to make invisible? or rely on adding the miHide class 
p) Should each passed in element of an object be checked if it exists?  If yes, how will it define what already exists?  [ie. mitoolbar exists many times, but the right one is needed.]  
	Perhaps, in the onLoad/onInit/onClick it should be able to take multiple classes inside parenthasis.  So toolbar(insertImage):['it0', 'it2(it3)'] should look for the element classed insertImage, and add a toolbar with that class if it does not exist. 
q) in index.htm it put the toolbar bottom left when floating.  should adjust for centering and for margins while floating.
r) should it prevent text from being inserted before it while inline?
s) pageTop & bottom should be inserted inline if float is false.
t) All hashes are now global, which means that no two instances of the class can have the same button doing different things.
Perhaps they should be namespaced so that buttons can be modified, and the buttons/updates will match whatever was set for that instance.

Design Decisions:
a) Logic of button check:
	at press, all other buttons within it's collection are reset.
	if execBtn - will be redepressed as needed.
	ignoreState == false, btn will show itself as pressed until reset (either by user function or by other button in collection being pressed). 
	ignoreState == true, button will not "press".  if a string, variable will be added to that which updateBtns checks on each press  [perhaps using the collection?].
b) What parameters should addCollection require?
	a) Currently handles following: a) buttons to add to collection.  b & c) placing d) name e) visibilty f) caller.
	Ideally should not require so much: 
		Buttons(cannot just pass location, as this is more flexible, and any button can have button list in more than one place)
		Containing div (key of object).  Optional, as it will use a plain div (with the styles of a tollbar from openwysiwyg) if none is passed.
		Group which the containing div is a part of.  -  explain - should groups be maintained separat
